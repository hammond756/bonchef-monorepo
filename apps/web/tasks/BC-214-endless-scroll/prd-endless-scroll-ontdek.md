# PRD: Endless Scroll for Discovery Page

This document outlines the requirements for implementing an "endless scroll" feature on the 'Discovery' page of BonChef.

### 0. Online Resources

- **Jira Ticket:** [BC-214](https://bonchef.atlassian.net/browse/BC-214)

### 1. Introduction/Overview

To increase user engagement and facilitate the discovery of new recipes, we are introducing an 'endless scroll' on the community recipes timeline. This eliminates the need for pagination and provides a seamless, uninterrupted browsing experience.

### 2. Goals

- Enable the user to scroll through the list of recipes without interruption.
- Increase user engagement by making inspiration discovery frictionless.
- Provide a smooth and responsive user experience, even when loading new content.

### 3. User Stories

- **As a user**, I want to be able to scroll infinitely through the list of community recipes so that I can find new inspiration without interruptions.

### 4. Functional Requirements

1.  **Initial Load:** Upon the first visit to the 'Discovery' page, the initial 10 recipes will be loaded.
2.  **Proactive Loading:** As the user scrolls through the initially loaded recipes, the next 10 recipes will be proactively fetched in the background.
3.  **Loading Indicator:** If a user scrolls to the bottom of the list faster than new recipes can be loaded, a clear visual loading indicator (e.g., a spinner) will be displayed.
4.  **End of List:** When all available recipes have been loaded, a message will be shown to the user, such as "You've seen all the recipes!".
5.  **Error Handling:** If fetching new recipes fails due to a network error or another technical issue, a clear error message will be displayed indicating that, unfortunately, no new recipes could be found.

### 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- There are no specific functionalities intentionally kept out of scope for this iteration.

### 6. Design Considerations

- The loading indicator must be visually appealing and consistent with BonChef's overall branding.
- The transition when loading new recipes should be as smooth as possible to avoid a jarring experience.

### 7. Success Metrics

- The feature is considered successful when the user reaches the bottom of the page and new recipes are automatically added without a page reload.
- The loading indicator is correctly displayed during loading.
- Error messages and the "end of list" message are displayed correctly in their respective scenarios.

### 8. Open Questions

- There are currently no open questions.
