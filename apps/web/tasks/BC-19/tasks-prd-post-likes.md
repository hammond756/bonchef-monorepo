- `src/components/like-button.test.tsx` - Unit tests for the like button component
- `src/components/recipe/recipe-action-buttons.tsx` - Modified to include the new like button
- `src/hooks/use-recipe-likes.ts` - Custom hook for managing like state and API calls
- `src/hooks/use-recipe-likes.test.ts` - Unit tests for the recipe likes hook
- `src/lib/services/recipe-like-service.ts` - Business logic service for like operations
- `src/lib/services/recipe-like-service.test.ts` - Unit tests for the recipe like service
- `src/lib/types.ts` - Updated to include like-related type definitions

- Use `npx playwright test` for E2E tests and follow existing test patterns
- Follow existing patterns from bookmark functionality for consistency
- Ensure proper TypeScript types are maintained throughout
