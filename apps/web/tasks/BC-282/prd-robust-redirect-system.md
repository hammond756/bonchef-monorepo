# Product Requirements Document: Robust Redirect System

## Online Resources
- **Jira Ticket**: https://bonchef.atlassian.net/browse/BC-282

## Introduction/Overview

Currently, the Bonchef application uses hard-coded `redirect` calls from Next.js scattered throughout pages, routes, and components, often behind conditional statements. This approach leads to inconsistent redirect behavior, makes the codebase harder to maintain, and creates potential issues with browser back button behavior.

This feature will implement a centralized, robust redirect system that provides a consistent and maintainable way to handle user redirections based on authentication state, previous page source, and other contextual conditions.

## Goals

1. **Centralize Redirect Logic**: Create a single, reusable redirect system that eliminates hard-coded redirects throughout the codebase
2. **Improve Maintainability**: Make redirect behavior predictable and easy to modify in one place
3. **Enhance User Experience**: Ensure consistent redirect behavior that respects browser navigation patterns
4. **Support Contextual Redirects**: Enable redirects based on user authentication state and previous page source
5. **Handle Edge Cases**: Provide graceful fallback behavior for invalid or inaccessible destinations

## User Stories

1. **As a user importing a recipe**, I want to be automatically redirected to my collection page after successful import, so that I can immediately see my newly imported recipe.

2. **As a new user creating an account**, I want to be redirected back to the page I was viewing before authentication, so that I can continue where I left off.

3. **As a user navigating the app**, I want redirects to work consistently with my browser's back button, so that I can navigate naturally through the application.

4. **As a developer**, I want to easily configure redirect behavior in one central location, so that I can maintain and modify redirect logic efficiently.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Redirect System
1. The system must provide a centralized redirect service that can be imported and used throughout the application
2. The system must support conditional redirects based on user authentication state
3. The system must support redirects based on previous page source (referrer)
4. The system must handle immediate redirects without loading states or confirmations
5. The system must preserve browser back button functionality

### Redirect Scenarios
6. The system must redirect users to the collection page after successful recipe import
7. The system must redirect users to their previous page after account creation, with fallback to a default page
8. The system must support redirects from any authenticated action to appropriate post-action pages

### Error Handling
9. The system must gracefully handle invalid or inaccessible redirect destinations by showing the default Next.js 404 page
10. The system must not break if redirect conditions cannot be determined

### Technical Implementation
11. The system must be compatible with Next.js App Router
12. The system must use TypeScript for type safety
13. The system must follow the existing codebase patterns and architecture
14. The system must be easily testable

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Analytics Tracking**: Redirects will not be tracked for analytics purposes
2. **Complex Loading States**: No loading indicators or confirmation dialogs before redirects
3. **URL Parameter Preservation**: No requirement to preserve complex URL parameters during redirects
4. **Deep Linking Support**: No special handling for deep link redirects beyond basic functionality
5. **Redirect History**: No requirement to maintain a history of redirects

## Design Considerations

- The redirect system should be implemented as a service that can be injected into components and pages
- Follow the existing service pattern used in the codebase (similar to other services in `src/services/`)
- Use TypeScript interfaces to define redirect configurations and conditions
- Integrate with the existing authentication system and user context

## Technical Considerations

- **Next.js Integration**: Must work seamlessly with Next.js `redirect()` function and App Router
- **Browser Navigation**: Ensure redirects work properly with browser back/forward buttons
- **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript to prevent runtime redirect errors
- **Service Architecture**: Follow the existing service pattern with dependency injection
- **Testing**: Must be easily testable with the existing test infrastructure

## Success Metrics

1. **Code Quality**: Reduce hard-coded redirects by 100% in favor of the centralized system
2. **Maintainability**: All redirect logic should be located in a single service file
3. **User Experience**: No reported issues with browser back button behavior after redirects
4. **Developer Experience**: New redirects can be added with minimal code changes
5. **Reliability**: Zero redirect-related errors in production

## Open Questions

1. Should the redirect system support redirect delays or timeouts for any scenarios?
2. Are there any specific redirect patterns that should be prioritized for the initial implementation?
3. Should the system support redirect chains (redirect A → redirect B → final destination)?
4. How should the system handle redirects in development vs production environments?

**Target Audience**: Junior developers implementing this feature should focus on creating a clean, type-safe service that integrates well with the existing codebase architecture while providing a simple API for other developers to use.
