# Plan

[x] Update backend database to allow User->Recipe relationship
[x] When a recipe is created, set the authenticated user as its owner
[x] All recipe endpoints should require authentication and should only return bonchef recipes _or_ the logged in users own recipes
[x] Implement supabase authentication in create prototype
[x] Do authenticated fetch call to create recipe
[x] write tests for public/private recipe endpoints
[x] Create the homescreen with all the users own recipes
[x] When a recipe is created, go back to the homescreen
[x] When a recipe is opened from the homescreen, it should open as a static page
