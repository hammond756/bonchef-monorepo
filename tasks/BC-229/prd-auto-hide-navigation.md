# Product Requirements Document: Auto-hiding Navigation Bars

### 0. Online Resources

- **Jira Ticket:** [BC-229](https://bonchef.atlassian.net/browse/BC-229)

### 1. Introduction/Overview

Currently, the `TopBar` and `TabBar` components within the `TabLayout` are fixed on the screen, which occupies valuable vertical space. This feature aims to improve the user experience by making these navigation bars automatically hide when the user scrolls down and reappear when they scroll up, thus maximizing the available area for content viewing.

### 2. Goals

- Maximize screen real estate for content on mobile and desktop devices.
- Create a more immersive and less intrusive user interface.
- Implement a smooth, modern, and intuitive navigation pattern.

### 3. User Stories

- As a user, I want the top and bottom navigation bars to hide when I scroll down so that I can focus on and see more of the page content.
- As a user, I want the navigation bars to reappear when I start scrolling up so that I can easily access navigation controls whenever I need them.

### 4. Functional Requirements

1.  When the user scrolls down on any page using the `TabLayout`, the `TopBar` must smoothly slide up and out of the viewport.
2.  Simultaneously, when the user scrolls down, the `TabBar` must smoothly slide down and out of the viewport.
3.  When the user begins to scroll up, both the `TopBar` and `TabBar` must smoothly slide back into their original positions.
4.  The appearance and disappearance of the bars must be tied directly to the scroll direction (down for hide, up for show).
5.  This behavior must be consistently applied across all pages that utilize the `TabLayout`.

### 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- This feature will not alter the internal content or functionality of the `TopBar` and `TabBar`.
- The implementation will be limited to the `TabLayout`; other layouts are not affected.
- There will be no option for the user to disable this auto-hiding behavior.

### 6. Design Considerations

- The animation for hiding and showing the bars should be a fluid slide-in/slide-out effect, not a fade or an abrupt disappearance.
- The transition duration should be quick enough to feel responsive but slow enough to be perceived as a smooth animation. A duration of 200-300ms is recommended as a starting point.

### 7. Technical Considerations

- This will likely require a React Hook (e.g., `useScrollDirection`) to monitor the window's scroll position and determine the vertical scroll direction.
- The state from this hook will be used within the `TabLayout.tsx` component to conditionally apply CSS classes or styles that control the visibility and position of the `TopBar` and `TabBar`.
- Framer Motion or simple CSS transitions can be used to handle the animations.

### 8. Success Metrics

- The `TopBar` and `TabBar` successfully hide on downward scroll and reappear on upward scroll on all relevant pages.
- The animation is smooth and free of visual glitches or "jank".
- The implementation does not negatively impact the application's performance, particularly scrolling performance.

### 9. Open Questions

- None at this time.
